Under the Contract Act, 1872 (applicable in Bangladesh), a breach entitles the non-breaching party to damages that naturally arise in the usual course of things or that parties knew to be likely when the contract was made. Specific performance may be available subject to equitable considerations. Parties may also stipulate liquidated damages, but penalties are not generally enforceable beyond reasonable compensation.
