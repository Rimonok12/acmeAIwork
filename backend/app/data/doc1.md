The Bangladesh Competition Act, 2012 prohibits agreements that cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in Bangladesh, including price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation. Certain practices may be treated as per se anti-competitive, while others require an assessment of their actual impact under a rule-of-reason style analysis considering market structure and consumer harm.
